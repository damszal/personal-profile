I am aware that not everything can be included on a single CV page. That is why I decided to create my own website, where I will share information that expands and complements my professional profile.

Here, you will learn what I have been doing over the years in the banking and logistics sectors, the challenges I have faced, and how, in my opinion, they can be addressed. You will also find out about the training courses I have completed, my interests, and what I do in my free time. In other words, everything there is no time to ask about during a job interview.
