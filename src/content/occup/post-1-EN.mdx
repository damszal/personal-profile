Since 2016, I have held a qualification certificate issued by UDT, authorizing me to operate lift trucks with mechanical lifting mechanisms (excluding trucks with a boom or those that lift the operator along with the load).

During my work, I have gained practical experience in operating various types of trucks, including:

- manual pallet trucks,
- manual trucks with a scale,
- manual scissor trucks,
- manual stacker trucks,
- electric pallet trucks,
- electric trucks with a platform,
- electric stacker trucks,
- battery-powered tow tractors,
- reach trucks for high-rack storage, including those with roll clamps and extendable forks for double pallet loading,
- counterbalance forklifts powered by electricity or internal combustion engines,
- trucks designed for ULD transport (commonly known as air cargo containers and pallets).


Thanks to my extensive experience, I possess practical knowledge of operating equipment in various conditions and work environments.

My responsibilities included loading and unloading trailers, both with pallets and oversized cargo. I also handled the picking of products from high racks up to 6 meters, transporting air cargo, and managing printing roll logistics.

Adhering to health and safety regulations and professional best practices is of utmost importance to me. I always pay attention to pedestrian priority, especially in areas not marked as transport paths, as well as to horizontal and vertical signs that ensure safe and smooth movement around the site. I take care of the equipment entrusted to me, including regularly topping up the batteries, checking the technical condition, keeping the forklift service log, and wearing appropriate work clothing. I also follow speed limits (maximum 6 km/h) and signal my presence in areas with limited visibility.
